# For our "Hello bakery!" example we extended the "Hello world!" script to read

# Read our config filed:

    cfg = json.load(json_file)

# The section should just use 7bit lowercase characters and underscores. They must 
# match the name set in register.check_plugin(). Make sure to choose a unique name
# to avoid having two plugins with the same name.

# percentage. The output will be space separated which will be split into tokens
# as CheckMK receives the output.
