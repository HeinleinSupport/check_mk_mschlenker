description:
 "Hello bakery!" is an example package primarily built for the purpose
 of showcasing minimal contents of a valid, usable package that can
 be uploaded to the CheckMK exchange. In comparison to "Hello world!"
 it extends the structure to bakery API plugin files that allow for
 distribution of this package to clients. The full example also allows
 for writing configuration files that include parameters set by agent
 rules and using post install or pre remove hooks.

 Expected agent output:

 <<<hello_bakery>>>
 
 hello_bakery 57.746

 The float is expected to be in the range between 0% and 100%. The
 sample agent relies on these four lines Python, store it as
 /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/helloworld and make sure it is 
 set executable. 

 Minimal sample agent script:

 #!/usr/bin/env python3
 
 from random import random
 
 print("<<<hello_bakery>>>")
 
 print("hello_bakery", random() * 100.0)

 Please see the example in usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/hello_world for
 our extended script that also reads the config and outputs one of the
 parameters configured via setup GUI. This "full" script will be passed to
 Linux clients in the baked DEB or RPM packages.

 In default settings, above 80% "hellolevel" the state changes from
 OK -> WARNING, issueing the message "Hello, I need some coffee!",
 above 90%, the state will be CRIT "Hello, leave me alone!".  
 
 Feel free to use the files contained in this MKP as a foundation for
 your first proper CheckMK plugin. Have fun!
