# Snippets and examples for CheckMK

Just a collection of snippets for CheckMK. These are either result of my paid work for tribe29 (the company behind CheckMK)
or part of my work for servers I maintain. Or they might be made just out of curiosity. 

Either way: Some of the snippets might find their way to other places like CheckMK documentation, in these cases, I'll mark
appropriately.
